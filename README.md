# ACC-Server-Control
Management platform for spinning up Assetto Corsa Competizione dedicated servers remotely .NET Core 3.1, Vue 2.0, Vuetify, ASP.NET, REST, PostGreSql

Assetto Corsa Competizione is a GT3 racing simulator. I built this platform to allow myself or other racers in my team to remotely spin up a dedicated server to race or practice on. This was entirely hosted in linux. Consists of a front-end built on Vue 2 Vuetify, allows user to select track, conditions and other parameters to customise a dedicated server. The frontend then translates the UI context into JSON and passes it to the .Net Core WebAPI which in turn translates the JSON into the local server configuration files. Also allows users to remotely start or stop servers, this involves the front-end sending a message to the webapi which in turn checks for the acc server process thread. It can then kill that thread if needed or it can execute the dedicated server application if the process thread is not currently running. Application could be extended to run multiple processes but might be more tricky to determine which is which. Also wanted to expand the ability to save configurations to postgresql.
